1. Change the PSD to HTML using Bootstrap
2. Remove the mouse from the first image of Related items
3. The type of item, which is the COAT, of first item is positioned below the name of item.
4. Change the Social Icons to SVG using fontello
5. Use JPEG images since there are no transparency used
6. Added a dotted line to split the body into two section

Improvements
1. Add the Login/Register button at the top-right
2. Add a Shopping Cart button

Bad things I did:
- Used a navbar of Bootstrap for the top navigation (should've made a normal button and paragraph)

Why I used Bootstrap
- I'm not really an expert in Bootstrap but recently, I've been trying to learn more about Bootstrap and thought this is a good chance to practice it.
